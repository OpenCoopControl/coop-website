# Flashing OpenCoopControl

This guide will help you flash the OpenCoopControl firmware to your ESP32 device.

## Prerequisites

1. An ESP32 development board
2. USB cable to connect the board to your computer
3. Python installed on your computer

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using Release Assets (Recommended for most users)

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/OpenCoopControl/coop-controller/releases) of the repository
2. Download the latest release assets:

   - For Windows: `flash_opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z.bat`
   - For Linux/Mac: `flash_opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z.sh`
   - Binary files:
     - `opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z_firmware.bin` (Main firmware)
     - `opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z_spiffs.bin` (Filesystem)
     - `bootloader.bin` (Required for full installation)
     - `partitions.bin` (Required for full installation)

3. Install esptool:
   ```bash
   pip install esptool
   ```
4. Connect your ESP32 to your computer
5. Run the flashing script:
   - On Windows: Double-click the .bat file and follow the prompts
   - On Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
   chmod +x flash_opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z.sh
   ./flash_opencoopcontrol_vX.Y.Z.sh
   ```
6. Choose your flashing mode:
   - **Option 1: Update firmware only** - This will keep your WiFi settings and configurations
   - **Option 2: Full installation** - This will erase all settings and return the device to factory state

### Method 2: Building from Source (For developers)

If you want to build the firmware yourself:

1. Install PlatformIO:
   ```bash
   pip install platformio
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OpenCoopControl/coop-controller.git
   cd coop-controller
   ```
3. Build and upload:
   `platformio run --target upload`
4. Upload the file system (contains the web interface):
   `platformio run --target uploadfs`

# Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Permission denied on Linux/Mac:

```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0  # Replace with your port!
```

2. Can't find COM port on Windows:
   - Check Device Manager to identify the correct COM port
   - Edit the .bat file to update the port number
3. Connection issues:
   - Make sure the ESP32 is in download mode by holding the BOOT button while connecting or resetting
   - Try a different USB cable or port
4. Flash failed:
   - Try a slower baud rate by editing the flash script to use --baud 115200 instead of 921600
5. Unable to connect to WiFi after flashing:
   - If you chose "Update firmware only" but are having issues, try the "Full installation" option instead
   - After a full installation, the device will create a WiFi AP named "OpenCoop-[ID]"

### LED Status Indicators

- When the ESP32 is properly flashed, the built-in LED will blink once during startup
- If the LED stays on, it indicates the device is in setup mode

### After Flashing

First-time Setup or After Full Installation

- The ESP32 will create a WiFi access point named "OpenCoop-[ID]"
- Connect to this WiFi network with your phone or computer
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1
- Follow the setup wizard to complete configuration

### After Firmware Update Only

- The device will reconnect to your WiFi network automatically
- Access the web interface using the device's IP address on your network
