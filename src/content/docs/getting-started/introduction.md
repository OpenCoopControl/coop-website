# Introduction to OpenCoopControl

OpenCoopControl is an open-source ESP32-based system for automating chicken coop management. The controller manages coop door operations, feeding schedules, and environmental monitoring through various sensors.

## What is OpenCoopControl?

OpenCoopControl is a comprehensive solution for automating and monitoring your chicken coop. It combines hardware and software to:

- Automatically open and close your coop door at specified times
- Dispense feed on a schedule
- Monitor temperature, light levels, and water levels
- Provide a web interface for monitoring and control
- Enable remote access through a simple API

The system is designed to be affordable, reliable, and easy to customize for your specific needs.

## Key Features

- **Automated Door Control**: Schedule door opening/closing based on time or light level
- **Automated Feeder**: Configure feeding times and durations
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track temperature, light levels, and water levels
- **Web Interface**: Local web dashboard for monitoring and control
- **API Endpoints**: Control and monitor your coop through HTTP requests
- **Easy Setup**: WiFi Manager for easy configuration without reflashing
- **Multilingual**: Interface available in multiple languages

## System Architecture

OpenCoopControl consists of the following main components:

1. **Hardware**: ESP32 microcontroller with connected sensors and actuators
2. **Firmware**: C++ code running on the ESP32 that handles all automation logic
3. **Web Interface**: Browser-based interface for monitoring and control
4. **API**: HTTP endpoints for programmatic control and integration

The system operates independently on your local network and doesn't require internet connectivity for its core functions.

## Benefits of Automation

Automating your chicken coop provides several benefits:

- **Convenience**: No need to manually open and close the coop door each day
- **Consistency**: Chickens benefit from a consistent routine
- **Security**: Door automatically closes at night to protect from predators
- **Peace of Mind**: Monitor your coop conditions remotely
- **Time Savings**: Less daily maintenance required
- **Adaptability**: System adjusts to changing seasons and daylight hours
