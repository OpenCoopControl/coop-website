# Configuring OpenCoopControl

This guide covers all the configuration options available in OpenCoopControl and how to adjust them to meet your specific needs.

## Initial Setup

When you first power on your OpenCoopControl device, it will create a WiFi access point named "OpenCoop-[ID]" where [ID] is a unique identifier for your device. To complete the initial setup:

1. Connect to this WiFi network from your phone, tablet, or computer
2. Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1
3. Follow the on-screen setup wizard

During the setup, you'll be asked to provide:

- Your home WiFi network credentials
- A name for your coop (e.g., "Backyard Coop")
- Your time zone

Once setup is complete, the device will connect to your WiFi network, and you can access it using the device's IP address on your local network or via mDNS at `opencoopcontrol.local` if your device supports it.

## Main Configuration Settings

All configuration is done through the web interface. Navigate to the Settings section to access the following options:

### Door Control Settings

## Network Configuration

If you need to change WiFi settings after initial setup:

1. Press and hold the manual door button for 10 seconds
2. The device will reset to setup mode and create the "OpenCoop-[ID]" access point
3. Follow the initial setup process again

Alternatively, you can directly edit network settings in the web interface under Settings > Network.

## Configuration Files

For advanced users, configuration is stored in JSON files on the device's SPIFFS filesystem:

- `/config.json` - Device configuration and network settings
- `/settings.json` - Operation settings (door times, feeder times, etc.)

**Note:** Direct editing of these files is not recommended and may cause the system to malfunction. Always use the web interface when possible.

## Configuration Backup and Restore

### Creating a Backup

1. Go to Settings > System > Backup
2. Click "Download Backup"
3. Save the .json file to your computer

### Restoring a Backup

1. Go to Settings > System > Restore
2. Click "Choose File" and select your backup .json file
3. Click "Upload and Restore"
4. The device will restart with the restored settings

## Factory Reset

If you need to completely reset your OpenCoopControl to factory settings:

1. Method 1: Press and hold the manual door button for 20 seconds
2. Method 2: Go to Settings > System > Factory Reset

After a factory reset, the device will return to setup mode, and all settings will be lost.

## Multi-Language Support

OpenCoopControl supports multiple languages. To change the interface language:

1. Go to Settings > System > Language
2. Select your preferred language from the dropdown
3. Click "Save Settings"

Currently supported languages:

- English
- Serbian

## Troubleshooting Configuration Issues

If you encounter problems with your configuration:

1. Check that values are within the acceptable ranges
2. Ensure your device is running the latest firmware
3. Try restarting the device after making changes
4. As a last resort, perform a factory reset and reconfigure
