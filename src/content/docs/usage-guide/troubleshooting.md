|                                  | If still unresponsive, perform full flash with recovery image |

## Hardware Troubleshooting

### Power Issues

1. **Insufficient power supply**: Ensure your power supply can provide at least 2A at 5V
2. **Voltage drops during operation**: Add a large capacitor (1000Î¼F) near the ESP32 power pins
3. **Intermittent resets**: Check for loose connections and adequate power supply

### Motor and Servo Troubleshooting

1. **Testing servos**: Use the manual test function in Settings > System > Hardware Test
2. **Motor doesn't run**: Check for 5V at the motor driver VCC pin
3. **Servo jitters**: Ensure separate power supply for servos or add large capacitor

### Connectivity Hardware Issues

1. **Poor WiFi reception**: Add an external antenna or WiFi extender
2. **Interference**: Move away from metal objects and other electronic devices

## Recovering from Major Failures

### Recovery Mode

To enter recovery mode:

1. Disconnect power
2. Hold the BOOT button on the ESP32
3. Reconnect power while holding BOOT
